# Pomodoro Timer ⏰🐾 

Feeling pawsitively unproductive? Need some purr-suasion to stay on track?  
Introducing the **Pomodoro Timer**, now with 100% more cat! Because who wouldn’t want a fluffy little motivator lounging on top of their timer? 😸

This isn’t just any productivity tool; it’s a **meow-nificent** way to boost your focus and break down your tasks into bite-sized intervals. Built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, you can even add it to your home screen—no cat hair included!

## ✨ Features
- Start, pause, and reset timers for work sessions and breaks—paw-sitively purr-fect for productivity.
- A cat sits on top of the timer to judge (or support) your progress. It’s motivational... in its own feline way.
- Configurable durations for both work and break intervals, because even cats need a catnap. 💤
- **Offline Support:** Works even without internet—unlike your cat, who still expects you to Google ‘why does my cat judge me?’"
- **Add to Home Screen:** Installable as a PWA on mobile and desktop—no kitty litter required.
- Dynamic feature flags with custom middleware, because why not?
- RESTful API for managing Pomodoro sessions. (No, the cat can’t delete your tasks, sorry.)
